Ever wondered whether [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is able to act as some kind of personal trainer, for instance by providing you with a workout plan according to your requests?
No?

Well, whatever the answer, now you can test ChatGPT models against this peculiar need: you can ask something like "Hello ChatGPT, I want to work out: can you please provide a workout plan?"

**gofit** is the CLI which empowers the user with a series of commands in order to build their ChatGPT connection, specifics and training details, in order to obtain a workout plan from ChatGPT itself.

This tool is entirely made with Golang, which I think is an extremely powerful and useful language to make simple, self-contained and small applications such as Command Line Interfaces - even if nowadays, in the industry, many companies use Golang as their main language for back-end microservcies (e.g. Docker, writing Operators, etc.). 
Lately I've been eager to explore a little more Golang and its wonderful [perks](https://medium.com/@julienetienne/why-go-the-benefits-of-golang-6c39ea6cff7e), and this funny idea I had gave me an excuse to write some Go code.

Many features are yet to be implemented, and the ones that made it into this very first and simpel release are far from perfect and complete, but in the meantime, if you want to check it out and give it a try, check the [gofit repository!](https://github.com/valgh/gofit).
