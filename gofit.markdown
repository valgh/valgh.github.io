Ever wondered whether [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is able to act as some kind of personal trainer, for instance by providing you with a workout plan according to your requests?
No?

Well, whatever the answer, now you can test ChatGPT models against this peculiar need: you can ask something like "Hello ChatGPT, I want to work out: can you please provide a workout plan?"

**gofit** is the CLI which empowers the user with a series of commands in order to build their ChatGPT connection, specifics and training details, in order to obtain a workout plan from ChatGPT itself.

This tool is entirely made with Golang, which I think is an extremely simple, powerful and useful language to make Command Line Interfaces (and only that!). Lately I've been eager to explore a little more Golang and its wonderful [perks](https://medium.com/@julienetienne/why-go-the-benefits-of-golang-6c39ea6cff7e), and this little idea i had gave me an excuse to write some Go code.

Many features are yet to be implemented, but in the meantime, if you want to check it out and give it try, check the [gofit repository!](https://github.com/valgh/gofit).
