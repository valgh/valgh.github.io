# Basic Vulnerability Assessment in IoT: Shodan and IoTSeeker

Performing a ***vulnerability assessment*** on ***IoT*** devices is a task that slightly differs from the classic and typical
***vulnerability assessment*** on general computerized systems, and this is due mostly to the deeply-connected nature of
***IoT*** devices and their relationship with the physical systems they interact with.

In this survey which was written and submitted - _but not evaluated_ (due to wrong timing reasons) - for the _Security Governance_ course at Sapienza University of Rome, a.y. 2019/2020, the issue is addressed by presenting and examining two of the most famous and exploited tools that are used to perform the assessment: [***Shodan.io***](https://shodan.io) and ***IoTSeeker***.
