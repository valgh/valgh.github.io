# About

I am a 25 year-old student, currently enrolled at the second year of the Master's Degree in Engineering in 
Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.
My main interests are cybersecurity, machine learning and everything concerning algorithms and data 
(e.g. data mining, information retrieval and privacy).

This space is meant to serve as a repository of the work I did and put on GitHub for sharing.
I like experimenting with code and stuff if I have time to spare, so some posts are likely to be made
in the future, here and there.
