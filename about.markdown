# About

I am a 29 year-old guy living in Rome, who pursued his Master's Degree in Engineering in 
Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.
My main interests are software engineering, cybersecurity, machine learning and everything concerning algorithms and data .
I am a 3YOE Software Engineer with Backend and Frontend Development skills, dealing mainly with JS/ReactJS, JavaEE/Spring architectures and Docker/Kubernetes.

This space is meant to serve as a repository of the work I did and put on GitHub for sharing.
I like experimenting with code and stuff if I have time to spare, so some posts are likely to be made
in the future, here and there.

Hope you'll enjoy this content!
