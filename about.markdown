# About

I am a 27 year-old boy living in Rome, who pursued his Master's Degree in Engineering in 
Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.
My main interests are software engineering, cybersecurity, machine learning and everything concerning algorithms and data 
(e.g. from data structures to data mining, information retrieval and privacy). 
Currently, I am a Software Engineer (Junior) with Frontend Development experience, mainly working with Js/REACTJS and Java languages. I recently started working as a backend developer, dealing mainly with C/C++/Java architectures and Docker/Kubernetes.

This space is meant to serve as a repository of the work I did and put on GitHub for sharing.
I like experimenting with code and stuff if I have time to spare, so some posts are likely to be made
in the future, here and there.

Hope you'll enjoy this content!
