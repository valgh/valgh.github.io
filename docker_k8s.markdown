Well, it's been a while since I last updated my Git page.
I have been busy building code (mainly React components for Web UI project) and experiencing my first year as a Software Engineer. Lately, I managed to spare some time to follow and complete some
courses on Udemy platform. I was captured by Stephen Grider's course on Docker and Kubernetes as I wanted to know more about these topics. If you, like me, want
to know more about containers and ways to set them up in production environments, I strongly encourage you to take a look at this course [here!](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) as
Stephen is an amazing teacher and covers every single detail about the awesome world of containers!

Files and code I've written during such course is also available on my Git repositories, but I strongly recommend you to star and follow Stephen's repositories which were made 
for his course and are surely more rerliable than mine!

_Coming soon: full experience with Stephen's course and Docker/k8s..._
